# Step 3: Team Possession and Player Movement Towards Ball

## Overview
Step 3 introduces more advanced team dynamics with possession mechanics and strategic player movement towards the ball.

## Key Features
- **Team Possession Logic**: The game now tracks which team currently has possession of the ball.
- **Ball Interception**: Possession switches to the opposing team when their player intercepts the ball.
- **Proactive Player Movement**: Players move towards the ball when it's not under their team's possession, aiming to gain control.

## Implementation Details
- The simulation distinguishes team possession and alters player behavior based on possession status.
- Players without the ball make strategic decisions to either move towards the ball or position themselves for tactical advantages.

## Next Steps
- Further enhancement of team strategies, including defensive tactics and goal-oriented behaviors.
