# NetLogoFootball
My attempt at making a football simulation using NetLogo, one step at a time.

## Project Overview
This project is a step-by-step development of a soccer simulation in NetLogo. It aims to simulate various aspects of a soccer game including player movement, ball handling, team strategies, and dynamic interactions between players.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Open the `football_simulation.nlogo` file in NetLogo.
- Use the `setup` and `go` buttons to run the simulation.

## Repository Structure
- `main` branch contains the latest complete version of the simulation.
- Separate branches for each development step (e.g., `step-1`, `step-2`, etc.).
- Step-specific README files provide details about each stage of development.

## Current Progress: Step 5
- Teams have been expanded to five players each, and player movement logic has been enhanced to maintain team formation and prevent clustering.

## Previous Steps:
#### Step 1
- Basic player and ball setup.
- Simple passing logic where players pass the ball to each other.

#### Step 2
- Introduction of two teams with distinct colors (blue and red).
- Players being able to direct the ball towards the team mate when in possession.

#### Step 3
- Implemented team possession mechanics.
- Players now move strategically towards the ball to gain possession.

#### Step 4
- Implemented defensive strategies with movement towards the player in possession for potential interception.
- Added logic for ball interception and possession switching.

## Next Steps
-  Step 6 will focus on improving player decision-making and introducing more nuanced team strategies.
