The following basic ideas have been implemented by step-1:
There are two players and a ball.
Passing Mechanism: When a player is near the ball, they can pass it 1 step closer to the second player.
Ball Movement: The ball will move towards the target player after a pass.
Players move randomly at every tick, and only pass if the randomly find themself close to the ball.
