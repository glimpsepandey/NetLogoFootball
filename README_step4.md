# Step 4: Defensive Movement and Interception Strategy

## Overview
Step 4 introduces defensive strategies, focusing on how the team not in possession maneuvers to intercept the ball.

## Key Features
- **Defensive Movement**: Players from the non-possessing team actively move towards the player with the ball.
- **Interception Logic**: Conditions under which a player can intercept the ball are defined, enhancing the realism of the simulation.

## Implementation Details
- Players on the defensive team identify the player with the ball and move towards them to attempt an interception.
- Interception occurs if a defending player gets sufficiently close to the player in possession, switching the ball possession to the intercepting player's team.

## Next Steps
- Further development of team strategies, including more complex interception conditions and offensive tactics.
- Enhancement of player positioning and movement based on game dynamics.
