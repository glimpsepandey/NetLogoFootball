# Step 2: Enhanced Player Movement and Basic Team Mechanics

## Overview
In Step 2 of the football simulation, we focus on enhancing player movement with the ball and introducing basic team mechanics.

## Key Features
- **Team Introduction**: Players are now divided into two teams, each identified by a unique color (blue and red).
- **Ball Possession and Movement**: Players with the ball move towards a specified direction (towards the goal), showcasing the beginnings of offensive play.
- **Distinct Player Behaviors**: Differentiated behavior for players with and without the ball. Players without the ball continue to move randomly.

## Implementation Details
- **Teams**: Players are initialized into two teams, adding a new layer of complexity to the simulation.
- **Player Movement with Ball**: The code now includes logic for players with the ball to move towards the opponent's goal.
- **Preserving Previous Logic**: The existing logic for random player movement and ball passing from Step 1 is maintained and built upon.

## Next Steps
- Further development of team strategies and player movement.
- More intricate ball handling and passing mechanics.
- Introduction of goals and scoring mechanics.
